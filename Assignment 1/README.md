To get the code for randomising the background colours when the page is clicked.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
When the code is opened it should produce a screen where a square is moving diagonally downwards. When it reaches the edge of the canvas the square will reset in a new position on the left hand side of the canvas.
The background colour is interactive, so when the user clicks anywhere on the screen the colour changes randomly. After a few clicks the background changes to either white or grey. Once this happens the trail will change colour instead. If the user continues to click the background will soon change and both the trail and background will randomise.
